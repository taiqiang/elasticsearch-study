=== Default settings are no longer supported
Previous versions of Elasticsearch allowed a user to set a default setting for
any setting. The default setting was only applied if the actual setting was not
already set. This feature was trappy, and the complexity that it introduced was
prone to bugs. Due to this, we have elected to make a breaking change in a
minor release to remove this feature with the exception of `default.path.conf`,
`default.path.data`, and `default.path.logs` which remain to support packaging.
A future version of Elasticsearch will remove support for these as well, so
users should stop relying on this functionality.
